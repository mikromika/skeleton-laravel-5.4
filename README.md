I am new with PHP and Laravel, I have started from zero knowledge with PHP.

I have started programmimg with php about four month ago.
First tried with Slim framework which is based for Laravel 4.

After I saw JaCurtis videos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwAKR305CRO-Q90J---jXVzbOd4CDRbVx"> How to Build a Blog with Laravel </a>

I swiched over to Laravel 5.3 -- This skeleton is based for L5.4.

Idea is go to step by step forward.

First project;
Blog - I am building two step registeration and merged adviced login system with user has diffrent roles and backend admin area. 

Second project  Sentinel, This skipped. I'll make it for my first and main project-

3rd: Later on, I'll start look at, how make these for my main project.

- app logs for Gui, github updates via simple GUI.
- user/roles management 
- Alert system which bring low level alert for Gui from backend. (mysql, postfix, dovecot...etc)
- Nagios / nmap extended
- Event channels; later expand for Telegram bot
- Push info to Twitter, and FB.
